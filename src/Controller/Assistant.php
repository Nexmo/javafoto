 * The Photographers Assistant, this IVR communicates with the general public and passes messages onto the Photographer.
 * Responsible for answering the phone, letting the Customer know to get ready, letting the Photographer know to take
 * the photos, and sending the Customer a link to the photos.
 *
 * Since the Developer needs time to upload the photos, the Assistant must generate a placeholder page, and send the
 * link to that. It's expected that the Developer will replace that placeholder once the photos are uploaded.
